Introduction to git using Ubuntu 17.04

Installation
The git version control system is installed with the following command

sudo apt install git
Configuration
Every git user should first introduce himself to git, by running these two commands:

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
Basic usage
The above is already sufficient to use git in a distributed and secure way, provided users have access to the machine assuming the server role via SSH. On the server machine, creating a new repository can be done with:

git init --bare /path/to/repository
This creates a bare repository, that cannot be used to edit files directly. If you would rather have a working copy of the contents of the repository on the server, ommit the --bare option.

Any client with SSH access to the machine can then clone the repository with:

git clone username@hostname:/path/to/repository
Once cloned to the client's machine, the client can edit files, then commit and share them with:

cd /path/to/repository
#(edit some files
git commit -a # Commit all changes to the local version of the repository
git push origin master # Push changes to the server's version of the repository
